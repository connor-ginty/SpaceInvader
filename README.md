# SpaceInvader

As I continue my journey to become more familiar with Python, I followed a tutorial on YouTube on freeCodeCamp.org's channel to create this program. A link to the vide will be provided below.

I am finished with the material in the tutorial, and plan to add a couple more features before I call it a day and move to a different side project. These are the features I added to the game that were not part of the tutorial:

- Difficulty Scaling: For every 10 points a player scores (capping at 100), the enemies will move faster.
